            Welcome to the Data Exchange! If you are reading this you are probably 
            wondering what exactly the data exchange is, so here is a brief explanation. 
            The data exchange is a place to buy and sell data. You can upload document to 
            sell, and also purchase other peoples documents. For example, if you are a 
            good note taker, you can sell your notes, and if you are a bad note taker like 
            me, you can buy them from someone else for a small fee. These transactions are 
            done with DataCoin, which you will eventually be able to exchange for USD once 
            the beta phase is over. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>What if the document I bought is bad or fake?</strong>
            <br>
            No need to worry! When you click purchase on a document you are not yet buying 
            it, merley agreeing to a contract which both sides need to fulfill. So if the 
            seller did not give you what you asked for, you have a 24 hour period to report 
            the document as faulty, and the DataCoins will immediately be sent back to your 
            account.
